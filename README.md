# STEM Class Projects Repository

Central repository for all coding and computational projects developed for our STEM class. This repository is organized by project, with each subdirectory containing the code, supporting files, and its own dedicated README.md for specific instructions and documentation.

# Repository Structure

The repository is structured to make navigation easy. You will find a distinct directory for each major project of the course.
